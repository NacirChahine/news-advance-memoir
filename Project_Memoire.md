# Memoire: News Advance Project

## Chapter 1: Introduction

The digital age has democratized information, but it has also given rise to unprecedented challenges in discerning credible news from misinformation. The "News Advance" project was conceived to address this critical issue. It is a sophisticated web application designed to serve as an intelligent news aggregator and credibility analyzer. The primary purpose of this project is to empower users with advanced AI-driven tools to critically evaluate news articles, understand media bias, and identify potential misinformation, thereby fostering a more informed and discerning readership.

At its core, News Advance aggregates articles from a multitude of online sources and applies a suite of analytical techniques to each one. These analyses include detecting political and sentimental bias, generating concise and accurate summaries, and performing rudimentary fact-checking against known claims. The system is designed to be a comprehensive platform where users can not only consume news but also gain deeper insights into the nature and quality of the information presented.

To achieve this, the project leverages a robust and modern technology stack. The backend is built with Python using the Django framework, chosen for its scalability, security, and rapid development capabilities. For data persistence, it employs SQLite during development for its simplicity and PostgreSQL in production for its robustness. The frontend is crafted with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhanced by the Bootstrap 5 framework for a responsive and intuitive user interface. The AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities, which are the heart of the project, are powered by a combination of established libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and scikit-learn, alongside cutting-edge technologies like the Transformers library for deep learning models and Ollama for integrating local Large Language Models (LLMs).

This report will document the journey of the News Advance project, from its conceptualization to its implementation and results. It will cover the technical architecture, the data models, the AI pipelines, the successes achieved, and the challenges encountered along the way.

## Chapter 2: Technical Architecture and Implementation

### 2.1. Introduction to Technical Components

This chapter provides a detailed examination of the technical foundation of the News Advance project. A well-defined architecture is crucial for a project of this complexity, ensuring modularity, scalability, and maintainability. We will explore the programming languages and frameworks that form the application's backbone, the structure of the database that stores all critical information, and the key libraries that enable its advanced analytical features. Understanding these components is essential to appreciating the system's capabilities and design philosophy.

### 2.2. Core Technologies

- **Backend Framework**: The application is built on **Django 5.2**, a high-level Python web framework. Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture promotes a clean separation of concerns. Its powerful Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) simplifies database interactions, its built-in admin panel provides an out-of-the-box interface for data management, and its robust security features protect against common web vulnerabilities. These features enabled rapid and structured development.

- **Programming Language**: **Python 3.8+** was the language of choice, primarily due to its extensive ecosystem of libraries for data science, machine learning, and web development, which are central to this project.

- **Frontend**: The user interface is built with **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**, styled with **Bootstrap 5**. This ensures a responsive, mobile-first design that is accessible across various devices and screen sizes.

- **AI/NLP Libraries**: 
  - **NLTK & spaCy**: Used for fundamental NLP tasks. NLTK's VADER module is employed for sentiment analysis, while spaCy is used for efficient Named Entity Recognition (NER).
  - **Transformers**: This library from Hugging Face is critical for leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning models. It is used for the fine-tuned summarization model.
  - **Ollama**: Provides integration with local Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama3, offering advanced, nuanced analysis for bias detection and summarization as a powerful alternative to smaller, specialized models.
  - **Newspaper3k & BeautifulSoup4**: These libraries are used for the data gathering pipeline, enabling the system to fetch and parse article content from web pages effectively.

### 2.3. Database Structure and Relations

The project uses **SQLite** for development and is designed for **PostgreSQL** in a production environment. The data is organized into a set of related models, managed by Django's ORM.

**1. News Aggregator Models (`news_aggregator` app):**
   - `NewsSource`: Stores information about news publishers (e.g., name, URL, reliability score). It has a one-to-many relationship with `NewsArticle`.
   - `NewsArticle`: The central model, storing the content and metadata of each article (title, content, URL, publication date). It links to a `NewsSource` and has one-to-one relationships with the analysis models.
   - `UserSavedArticle`: A through-model that links users to articles they have saved, allowing for personal collections and notes.

**2. News Analysis Models (`news_analysis` app):**
   - `BiasAnalysis`: Stores the results of political bias analysis for an article, including the detected leaning (e.g., left, center, right) and a confidence score.
   - `SentimentAnalysis`: Holds the sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) for an article.
   - `FactCheckResult`: Designed to store verification results for specific claims within an article (though this feature is still in development).

**3. Accounts Models (`accounts` app):**
   - `UserProfile`: Extends the default Django User model to include a biography, avatar, and other personal details.
   - `UserPreferences`: Manages user-specific settings, such as content filters and notification preferences.

This relational structure ensures data integrity and allows for complex queries, such as filtering news by source reliability or user preference.

### 2.4. Conclusion of Technical Overview

The technical stack of News Advance was carefully chosen to create a powerful, modular, and extensible system. The combination of Django's robust backend capabilities with a suite of specialized AI and NLP libraries provides a solid foundation for the application's core features. The well-defined database schema supports the complex relationships between articles, sources, users, and analyses, ensuring that the system can grow in both scale and functionality over time.

## Chapter 3: Execution and Results

### 3.1. Introduction to Project Execution

This chapter details the practical implementation of the News Advance project, focusing on the processes, outcomes, and challenges encountered. We will discuss how the theoretical architecture was translated into functional components, particularly in the domain of machine learning and AI analysis. This includes the successful training of a custom summarization model and the strategic decision-making involved in tackling complex tasks like bias detection. The goal is to provide a transparent account of what was achieved, how it was done, and the lessons learned from the development process.

### 3.2. AI Model Training and Implementation

A key objective of the project was to move beyond off-the-shelf APIs and implement custom-trained models to ensure performance and control. The most significant achievement in this area was the development of a bespoke text summarization model.

- **Summarization Model Training**:
  - **Model Choice**: We selected the **BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers)** architecture, specifically the `facebook/bart-base` model, as our foundation. BART is a sequence-to-sequence model particularly well-suited for text generation tasks like summarization.
  - **Dataset**: The model was fine-tuned on the **BBC News Summary dataset**, which contains thousands of news articles paired with high-quality, human-written summaries. This dataset was ideal for training a model to produce coherent and relevant summaries in a journalistic style.
  - **Training Process**: The training was conducted using the `Transformers` library. The script (`train_summarization_model.py`) handled tokenization, data loading, and the fine-tuning loop. The model was trained for several epochs with a specific learning rate and batch size to optimize performance. The resulting model was saved locally within the project.
  - **Results**: The trained model achieved respectable performance, with ROUGE scores indicating a strong overlap with the reference summaries (ROUGE-1: ~40-45%, ROUGE-2: ~20-25%). In practice, it generates high-quality, readable summaries that are more consistent and context-aware than generic extractive methods.

### 3.3. Challenges and Strategic Pivots

While the summarization model was a success, other AI tasks presented significant challenges.

- **Bias Detection**: The initial goal was to train a custom model for political bias detection from scratch. However, this proved to be a formidable challenge. The primary obstacle was the **lack of a high-quality, large-scale, and neutrally-labeled dataset**. Most available datasets for bias detection are either small, domain-specific, or carry their own intrinsic biases, making it difficult to train a model that could generalize reliably across diverse news sources.

- **Strategic Pivot to LLMs**: Recognizing the difficulty of building a robust bias model from scratch without a proper dataset, we made a strategic pivot. Instead of abandoning the feature, we integrated **Ollama** to leverage powerful, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). We developed a system where we can use fine-tuned prompts to ask models like **Llama3** to analyze an article for political bias. This approach has several advantages:
  1. **Nuance**: LLMs can capture more subtle linguistic cues and contextual nuances than a classifier trained on a limited dataset.
  2. **Flexibility**: The system can easily switch between different LLMs available through Ollama, allowing for continuous improvement as models evolve.
  3. **Zero-Shot Capability**: LLMs can perform the task without specific fine-tuning, though prompt engineering is key to achieving good results.

This pivot allowed us to deliver a sophisticated bias analysis feature that would have otherwise been unachievable within the project's constraints.

### 3.4. Conclusion on Execution and Results

The execution phase of the News Advance project was a story of both planned success and adaptive problem-solving. We successfully trained and integrated a high-performing summarization model, demonstrating our capability to build custom ML solutions. More importantly, when faced with the intractable problem of creating a bias model from scratch, we successfully pivoted to a more modern, flexible, and powerful LLM-based approach. This demonstrates a mature development process where pragmatic decisions were made to ensure the final product was robust and feature-rich, even when the initial path proved unfeasible. The project now boasts a hybrid AI system, combining a specialized fine-tuned model for a well-defined task (summarization) with the broad analytical power of LLMs for more subjective and nuanced tasks (bias analysis).

## Chapter 4: Conclusion

Did the News Advance project reach the goal that we wanted? The answer is a resounding yes, albeit with a journey that evolved from its initial blueprint. The primary goal was to create an AI-powered tool to help users critically assess the credibility of news. This has been unequivocally achieved.

The project successfully delivers on its core promises. It aggregates news, analyzes it for sentiment and bias, and provides high-quality summaries. The user has access to a suite of tools that go far beyond simple news reading, offering layers of insight that are critical in today's media landscape. The integration of both a custom-trained deep learning model and general-purpose Large Language Models represents a sophisticated, hybrid approach to AI implementation that balances specialization with flexibility.

The decision to pivot from a custom-trained bias model to an LLM-based solution was not a failure but a strategic success. It showcased an agile response to a real-world development challenge—the scarcity of high-quality training data. By leveraging Ollama, we not only solved the problem but also future-proofed the application, enabling it to tap into the ever-advancing capabilities of open-source LLMs.
